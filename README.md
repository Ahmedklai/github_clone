This project was part of an UI Clone challenge, the idea was to replicate (partially) the Github's Profile page using ReactJS , styled-components , userStories . I tried to use both SOLID and DRY principles along the way .
Also the the data Fetching we used GraphQl Api from Github and get along with their explorer to deliver the desired data to the front end 


Deployed [here](https://638c4465113ea74de7b5e16f--mvstgithubclone.netlify.app).

## FeedBack 

Honestly my first web/mobile app was a clone of Instagram so it was challenging and I learnt more than I could ever read in any book .. You will learn 'How did they do that'? And who knows, you might end up making improvement on it .. but keep in mind that software (especially web software) is like an iceberg. The part that you see is a tiny fraction of what the application actually does and the constraints they operate under .. so i really like the work and working with Graphql was also good since i worked with it before amd the big challenge was the time since i'm a student and a part-time software engineer , but I"M ALWAYS UP FOR CHALLENGES .

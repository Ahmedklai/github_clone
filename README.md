## MVST CLONE UI CHALLENGE BY AHMED KLAI

[![Build Status](https://github.com/Ahmedklai/github_clone.git)]



This project was part of an UI Clone challenge, the idea was to replicate (partially) the Github's Profile page using ReactJS , styled-components . I tried to use both SOLID and DRY principles along the way .

## Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [React] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
- [GraphQl] - awesome web-based text editor
- [StyledComponents] - Visual primitives for the component age.


And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

## Plugins

Dillinger is currently extended with the following plugins.
Instructions on how to use them in your own application are linked below.

| Plugin | README |
| ------ | ------ |
| Dropbox | [plugins/dropbox/README.md][PlDb] |
| GitHub | [plugins/github/README.md][PlGh] |
| Google Drive | [plugins/googledrive/README.md][PlGd] |
| OneDrive | [plugins/onedrive/README.md][PlOd] |

## Development



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

This project was part of an UI Clone challenge, the idea was to replicate (partially) the Github's Profile page using ReactJS , styled-components . I tried to use both SOLID and DRY principles along the way .
Deployed [here](https://discord.ui-clone.ronne.dev).

## Development

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.



### `npm run storybook`
It will start Storybook locally and output the address. Depending on your system configuration,
it will automatically open the address in a new browser tab, and you'll be greeted by a welcome screen.



### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
